# Reference Figma for Design Guidelines

- Utilize the Figma MCP connection when creating components. Prompt for a Figma design link if one has not been provided.
- If Figma design system variable names do not exactly match the CSS variable names used in the codebase, stop and ask for the correct token to reference.
- Use the code from Figma as a guideline for colors, spacing, and sizing but ALWAYS use the closest values from the project's codebase. If an exisiting value cannot be found, you may ask if it should be added to the codebase.
- Components can be found in this library: https://www.figma.com/design/sfDfusft9riuZlH5cGVZwr/-shadcn-ui---Design-System--Community-?node-id=2-287&m=dev&t=fmswLKEKtEDAcrMV-1
