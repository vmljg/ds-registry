# Ask Clarifying Questions Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow guides you to identify unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous user instructions and ask targeted clarifying questions before proceeding with a task.

## When to Activate This Workflow
Activate when you encounter:
- Vague or general requests (e.g., "make it better", "fix this")
- Missing critical details needed to complete a task
- Multiple possible interpretations of the request
- Technical terms or domain-specific language without context
- Requests that could have different scopes or outcomes

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Assessment
Before responding, analyze the user's request for:
- **Specificity**: Are the requirements concrete and measurable?
- **Completeness**: Do you have all necessary information?
- **Clarity**: Is there only one reasonable interpretation?
- **Context**: Do you understand the domain, use case, or background?

### 2. Identify Information Gaps
List what you need to know:
- Technical specifications or constraints
- Desired outcomes or success criteria
- Target audience or use case
- Scope and boundaries
- Preferences or priorities
- Examples of desired results

### 3. Formulate Clarifying Questions
Structure your questions to be:
- **Specific** - Target one piece of information per question
- **Open-ended** when exploring options - "What kind of..."
- **Closed-ended** when confirming specifics - "Should this..."
- **Contextual** - Reference what the user has already shared

### 4. Response Template


I'd be happy to help with [general understanding of request]. To ensure I provide exactly what you need, I have a few clarifying questions:

[Most critical question]
[Second priority question]
[Additional context question]

[Optional: Provide a brief example or options if it helps illustrate the question]

Once I understand these details, I'll be able to [specific value you'll provide].


## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Vague Technical Request
**User**: "Can you optimize this code?"

**Response**:
"I'd be happy to help optimize your code. To provide the most relevant suggestions, could you clarify:

1. What specific performance issues are you experiencing? (e.g., slow execution, high memory usage)
2. What metrics or goals define 'optimized' for your use case?
3. Are there any constraints I should consider? (e.g., maintaining readability, specific language features)

This will help me focus on the optimizations that matter most for your situation."

### Scenario 2: Ambiguous Content Request
**User**: "Write something about AI"

**Response**:
"I'd be glad to write about AI. To create content that meets your needs, could you help me understand:

1. Who is your target audience? (e.g., technical professionals, general public, students)
2. What aspect of AI interests you most? (e.g., current applications, future possibilities, ethical considerations)
3. What format works best? (e.g., article, summary, tutorial)
4. Approximately how long should it be?

With these details, I can tailor the content to your specific requirements."

## Best Practices
- Don't ask more than 3-5 questions at once
- Prioritize questions that most impact the outcome
- Acknowledge what you do understand from their request
- Offer to proceed with assumptions if they prefer
- Be prepared to iterate if their answers reveal new ambiguities

## When NOT to Use This Workflow
- When the request is already clear and specific
- For simple, straightforward questions
- When context from previous conversation provides clarity
- In emergency or time-critical situations (note this and proceed with best judgment)
