# Feature: RSS Feed

**As a developer,**

- I want to create an RSS feed that is populated from a SQLite database
- So that users can subscribe to the feed and receive updates from the database

#### Background:

- **Given** the application uses a SQLite database
- **And** the database contains a table named "posts" with columns "id", "title", "content", and "published_at"

#### Scenario: Creating an RSS feed

- **Given** I am on the homepage
- **When** I visit the RSS feed URL
- **Then** I should see an RSS feed with items from the "posts" table
- **And** each item should have a title equal to the "title" column
- **And** each item should have a description equal to the "content" column
- **And** each item should have a pubDate equal to the "published_at" column
