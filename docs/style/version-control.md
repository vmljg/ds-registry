# Version Control

- MUST: Write clear, descriptive commit messages; atomic commits; follow the projects branching strategy.
- SHOULD: Rebase before merge; use feature branches for new work; review your own changes.
- MAY: Use git hooks for pre-commit checks.
- MAY: Follow conventional commits specification.
- MAY: Use semantic versioning for releases.
